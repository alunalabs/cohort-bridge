A secure, privacy-preserving record linkage system using Bloom filters, MinHash signatures, and commutative encryption for HIPAA-compliant patient matching across multiple healthcare institutions.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture

This system implements a complete pipeline for privacy-preserving record linkage:

1. **Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL)** - Bloom filters with noise injection and MinHash signatures
2. **Secure Blocking** - Commutative encryption using Pohlig-Hellman over Curve25519
3. **Candidate Matching** - LSH-based blocking with encrypted bucket exchange
4. **Fuzzy Matching** - Hamming distance and Jaccard similarity with secure comparison protocols
5. **Test Harness** - Comprehensive validation with synthetic datasets

## üîß Components

## Output Directory Structure

All generated outputs are automatically saved to the `out/` directory:

- **Match Results**: `out/matches_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<connection_id>.csv`
- **Detailed Results**: `out/match_details_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS_<connection_id>.csv`
- **Validation Results**: `out/validation_results.csv` (when using validate command)
- **Test Outputs**: `out/dataset1.jsonl`, `out/dataset2.jsonl`, etc.

All log files are saved to the `logs/` directory (when logging is enabled).

The system automatically creates these directories if they don't exist.

## Privacy-Preserving Record Linkage (PPRL) System

This system provides secure, privacy-preserving record linkage between two parties using Bloom filters and cryptographic protocols. It enables organizations to identify matching records without sharing raw personally identifiable information (PHI).

## üîê **NEW: Tokenization Mode**

The system now supports **two modes of operation**:

### **Raw PHI Mode** (Original)
- Processes raw patient data directly during matching
- Suitable for trusted environments
- PHI is converted to Bloom filters in real-time

### **Tokenized Mode** (Enhanced Security)
- **Pre-processes PHI** into privacy-preserving tokens using the `tokenize` tool
- **Separates PHI handling** from the matching process
- **Enhanced security** - raw PHI never leaves the tokenization environment
- **HIPAA-friendly** deployment with isolated PHI processing

```bash
# Step 1: Tokenize your data (secure environment)
./tokenize.exe -input data/patients_a.csv -output out/tokens_party_a.json

# Step 2: Run matching with tokens (can be less secure environment)
./agent.exe -mode receive -config config_tokenized.yaml
```
